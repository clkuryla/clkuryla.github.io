I study how health can be understood not just as the absence of disease, but as a dynamic systems property - emerging from the body’s capacity to adapt across time, stressors, and environments.

My work brings together complexity science, time series analysis, and environmental epidemiology to explore intrinsic health and physiological resilience. I’m currently developing a Dynamic Health Index (DHI) - a composite metric that quantifies health using physiological time series data from wearables (such as Fitbit and Oura rings) and Holter monitors.

I'm working on my PhD at Columbia University, where I'm advised by Dr. Alan Cohen, whose lab investigates aging and complexity in biological systems, and Dr. Sen Pei, who studies complex systems in public health.
