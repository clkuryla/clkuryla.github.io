My research centers on understanding health and resilience as emergent properties of complex physiological systems. Iâ€™m especially interested in:

**Physiological Complexity**: How patterns in time series data (e.g., heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, temperature, galvanic skin response, activity, sleep) reflect the adaptability and stability of the human body.

**Intrinsic Health**: Investigating health as a systems-level state, rather than as the absence of specific diseases.

**Quantitative Methods**: Applying tools from complexity science (e.g., entropy, fractality, transfer entropy), statistical modeling, time series representation learning, and deep learning to characterize health dynamics.

**Self-Rated Health**: Exploring interesting patterns in the deceptively simple yet powerful survey question: In general, would you say your health is... [Excellent/Very Good/Good/Fair/Poor].

**Environmental Stressors**: Examining how exposures like heat waves and humidity influence physiological resilience and population health.

**Multiscale Integration**: Bridging wearable sensor data, clinical Holter monitors, and population health surveys to compare health signals across  scales.
