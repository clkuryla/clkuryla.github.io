# About me

Hi, I’m Christine Lucille Kuryla. I’m working on a PhD at Columbia University, where I study how health can be understood not just as the absence of disease, but as a dynamic systems property - emerging from the body’s capacity to adapt across time, stressors, and environments.

My work brings together complexity science, time series analysis, and environmental epidemiology to explore intrinsic health and physiological resilience. I’m currently developing the Multiscale Health Dynamics Index (MHDI) - a composite metric that quantifies health using physiological time series data from wearables (such as Fitbit and Oura rings) and Holter monitors.

I am advised by Dr. Alan Cohen, whose lab investigates aging and complexity in biological systems, and Dr. Sen Pei, who studies complex systems in public health.

Outside of research, I love dancing, hosting themed parties (that occasionally include an ML component -- [IYKYK](https://lovescience.club/about)), and designing sparkly, low-MOOP outfits.
